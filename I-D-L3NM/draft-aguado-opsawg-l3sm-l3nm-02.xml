    <abstract>

	  <t> RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data model that
   can be used for communication between customers and network
   operators.  It assumes that there is a monolithic management system
   with full control of transport resources.  This approach (that is
   valid for the customer to network operator conversation) limits the
   usage of the model to the role of a Customer Service Model, according
   to the terminology defined in RFC8309.</t>

   <t>There is a need for a YANG model for use between the entity that
   interacts directly with the customer (service orchestrator) and the
   entity in charge of network orchestration and control which,
   according to RFC8309, can be referred as Service Delivery Model.  In
   some cases, the control of the network is further expanded into perdomain control.</t>

   <t>This document uses the L3SM defined in RFC8299, and extends it
   to facilitate communication between the service orchestrator  transport orchestrator
   and domain controllers.
   The resulting model is called the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM).</t>

    <section title="INTRODUCTION">
	<t><xref target="RFC8299"></xref>  defines a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) YANG data
   model that  can be used for communication between customers and
   network operators.  Although the intention to provide an abstracted
   view of the customer's requested services is clear, the assumption is
   that the model is applied at the top of a monolithic management
   system with full control of transport resources.  That assumption
   substantially limits the usage of the L3SM to the role of a Customer
   Service Model, according to the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC8309"></xref>.</t>


   <t>The YANG data model defined in this document is called the L3VPN Network
   Model (L3NM).  It enables further capabilities, such as resource
   management or to serve as a multi-domain orchestration interface,
   where transport resources must be synchronized. The YANG module has been built with
   a prune and extend approach, taking as a starting points the YANG model described
   in <xref target="RFC8299"></xref>.</t>


  <t> This document does not obsolete, but complements, the definitions in
   <xref target="RFC8299"></xref>.  It aims to provide a different
   scope for the L3SM, but does not attempt to address all deployment
   cases especially those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported
   through the coordination of different VPNs in different underlying
   networks.  More complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of different VPN
   instances and different technologies to provide end-to-end VPN
   connectivity are addressed by a complementary YANG model defined in
   [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].</t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="TERMINOLOGY">
      <t>This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of <xref target="RFC6241"></xref>,  <xref target="RFC7950"></xref>,  <xref target="RFC8299"></xref>, <xref target="RFC8309"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC8453"></xref> and uses terminology from those documents.

                 "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

      </section>
    </section>


    <section title="REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE">
      <t>Figure 1 shows where the L3NM is used in a management stack.  The
   figure is an expansion of the architecture presented in <xref target="YANG_module"></xref> of
   <xref target="RFC8299"></xref> and decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that
   figure into three separate functional components called "Service
   Orchestration", "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".</t>

   <t>Note that some implementations may choose to construct a monolithic
     orchestration component, but this document assumes that there are
     many benefits for flexiblity of implementation and deployment to
     separate the functional components, and that separation demands the
     existence of sepearate YANG models to be used between the components.</t>

   <t>At the same time, terminology from <xref target="RFC8309"></xref> is introduced to show
   the distinction between the "Customer Service Model", the "Service
   Delivery Model", the "Network Configuration Model", and the "Device
   Configuration Model".  In that context, the "Domain Orchestration"
   and "Config Manager" roles may be performed by "Controllers".</t>

<section anchor="YANG_explanation" title=" YANG MODEL EXPLANATION">

	<t>The scenarios covered in the L3NM model includes: the integration of Ethernet and encapsulation parameters,
    the extension for transport resources (e.g., Route targets and Route distinguishers) to be orchestrated from the management system,
    far-end configuration of PEs not managed by the management system and the definition for PE identification. </t>

		<section anchor="structure_model" title="STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL">
		 <t>The YANG module is divided into three main containers: "vpn-services","sites" and "vpn-profiles". </t>
		 </section>

		<section anchor="sites_beares" title="SITE AND BEARERS">
		 <t>A site, as per <xref target="RFC8299"></xref>, represents a connection of a customer office to one or more VPN services. As this YANG module, is the network view, each site is associated with a list of bearers. A bearer is the layer two connections with the site. In the module it is assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the Service Provider (e.g., by the service orchestrator).
     The bearer is associated to a network element and a port. Hence, a bearer is not just a bearer-reference, but also a true reference to a given port in the service provider network.</t>
		 </section>

		<section anchor="bearerethencap" title="BEARER AND ETHERNET ENCAPSULATION">
		 <t>The definition of a L3VPN is commonly specified not only at the IP layer, but also requires to identify parameters at the Ethernet layer, such as encapsulation type (e.g., VLAN, QinQ, QinAny, VxLAN, etc.). This specification is not supported in <xref target="RFC8299"></xref>, whilst it suggests that any extension on this direction shall be implemented via augmentation of the bearer container.
     The extension defined to cope with these parameters uses the connection container inside the site-network-access defined by the <xref target="RFC8466"></xref>. This container defines protocol parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2. In the context of L3SM, the augmentation includes only mandatory parameters for the service configuration, which are mainly related to the interface encapsulation.
     Other definitions from L2SM connection container are left aside. For example, Link Aggregation (LAG) information is not required and it shall be configured prior to the service configuration, being the aggregated interface identified in the model as the bearer-reference, as discussed later in <xref target="mdrmanagement"></xref>.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="mdrmanagement" title="MULTI-DOMAIN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT">
      <t>The implementation of L3VPN services which span across administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the administration of different management systems or controllers) requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
        Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the usage of unavailable resources. For example, RTs shall be synchronized between PEs. When every PE is controlled by the same management system, RT allocation can be performed by the system.
        In cases where the service spans across multiple management systems, this task of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains, therefore, the service model must provide a way to specify RTs. In addition, RDs must also be synchronized to avoid collisions in RD allocation between separate systems. An incorrect allocation might lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being exported by different PE routers.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="rfeconfiguration" title="REMOTE FAR-END CONFIGURATION">
      <t>Depending on the control plane implementation, different network scenarios might require additional information for the L3VPN service to be configured and active. For example, an L3VPN Option C service, if no reflection of IPv4 VPN routes is configured via ASBR or route reflector, may require additional configuration (e.g. a new BGP neighbor) to be coordinated between both management systems.
        This definition requires for every management system participant in the VPN to receive not just their own sites and site-network-accesses, but also to receive information about external ones, identified as an external site-network-access-type. In addition, this particular site-network-access is augmented to include the loopback address of the far-end (remote/external) PE router.

    <t><xref target="RFC8299"></xref> states that the "bearer-reference" parameter is used in cases where the customer has already ordered a network connection to the service provider (SP) apart from the IP VPN site and wants to reuse this connection. The string used is an internal reference from the SP and describes the already-available connection. Usually, a client interface (either a customer one or an interface used by the SP) is already in place and connected, although it has not being use previously. In some other cases (e.g., for stitching purposes), the termination of a VPN service is done over logical terminations within a PE router.</t>
	<t>The bearer-reference must serve as a strict unequivocal parameters to identify the connection between a PE and a client (CE). This means that, despite the type is maintained as a string and there is no restriction in the way this data is formed, the bearer-reference must serve as the unique way to identify the PE router and the client interface. This, together with the encapsulation augments proposed in <xref target="sites_beares"></xref>, serves as the way to identify the client interface and configure L2 specific parameters.</t>

 <section anchor="Design_of_the_data_model" title="DESING OF THE DATA MODEL">
      <t>The augmentations defined in this document are organised per scenario, as defined in <xref target="YANG_explanation"></xref>. The case described <xref target="mdrmanagement"></xref> does not need any further extension of the data model and only requires a more restricted definition on how the data model is used for PE router and client port identification, so no augmentation is implemented for this scenario.</t>
		  <t>The augmentations implemented are distributed as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>An extension including RT and RD definition for the L3VPN, following the YANG definitions from BESS-L3VPN. This extension was developed creating a container "ie-profiles" under the VPN Service. All the import-export information can be created and reused for several VPN-Nodes.
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>If the "ie-profile" is empty the domain controller should automatically assing RD and RTs. This is not valid for a multi-domain scenario </t>
              </list></t>
            <t>The second augmentation copes with the information from a remote PE not directly under management system supervision. This augmentation does not follow any previously defined model and includes the loopback IP address of the external router.</t>
            <t>The third augmentation copes with a pseudowire termination under a VPN service. This termination requires the management of the Virtual Circuit Identifier under the VPN service.</t>
            <t>Access-group-id has been added within the site network access in order to allow associations between interfaces that have similar behaviors. For example, identify two interfaces in dual homing distribution.</t>
            <t>The last augmentation includes information below layer 3 that is required for the service. In particular, we include information related to clients interface encapsulation and aggregation.</t>
        </list></t>
